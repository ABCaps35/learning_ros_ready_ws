coordination commands:
Start up gazebo, add starting pen, tables and blocks, spawn baxter-on-mobot:  
 (optirun) `roslaunch baxter_variations baxter_on_mobot.launch` 


Launch multiple nodes, including 6 action servers, 2 services,  and rviz (including trajectory streamers, 
cartesian planner, rviz, baxter-playfile,  triad_display, object-grabber, object-finder and coordinator).  Same
as coordinator for baxter on pedestal:
`roslaunch coordinator coord_vision_manip.launch`

Optionally, test with this example client of the coordinator:
`rosrun coordinator coordinator_action_client_tester`

Start up map server (with starting-pen map), amcl, and move_base with 4 nav config files.  Nearly identical
to nav-launch in Part-4, except do not start up rviz (again):

`roslaunch baxter_variations mobot_startup_navstack.launch`
