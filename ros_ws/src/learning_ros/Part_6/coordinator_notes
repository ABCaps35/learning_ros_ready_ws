coordinator notes: navigate, find_object, grab_object, place_object

make a "playfile" for actions:

navigate TABLE_APPROACH_1   
  code for TABLE_APPROACH_1 ...expands to a 3-D pose for mobot
  subdivides: plan_path, navigate_path
  
find_object OBJECT_CODE_1
  OBJECT_CODE_1 presumably points to lots of info re/ object
  uses PCL to find table, filter object pts, fit model-> model pose
  
grab_object OBJECT_CODE_1
   presumably have pose in memory
   can look up grasp options
   compute arm trajectory, including:
      gross approach, gripper open, approach, close gripper, depart
      
navigate TABLE_APPROACH_2
place_object OBJECT_POSE_2
  OBJECT_POSE_2 lookup: perhaps relative to local features? sub-assembly? table coords?
     e.g. dishwasher, cupboard, closet, bin, box, ...
  compute Cartesian approach to goal pose, open gripper, depart

...........alternative:
discover_object
store_object  (driven by context)
  look up object home instructions, navigate, drop-off
