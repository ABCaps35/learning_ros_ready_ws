section 10.1:map making

can try this with simple 2D robot:


start stdr:
  roslaunch stdr_launchers server_with_map_and_gui_plus_robot.launch 

examine the named frames; run:
  rosrun tf view_frames 
  then open the generated pdf

To run slam_gmapping, we will need a frame called "base_link".  We can define this frame
and make it coincident with robot0 by running a static transform publisher:

Usage: static_transform_publisher x y z qx qy qz qw frame_id child_frame_id  period(milliseconds) 
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 robot0 base_link 100

after starting this node, re-run rosrun tf view_frames and note that base_link now exists.
(note: need base_link as a child, not a parent)
 
start rviz:
rosrun rviz rviz
  add display item for laserscan, topic = /robot0/laser_0
    use robot0 frame or base_link frame
    note: frame_id of laser data is robot0_laser_0, but this is connected in the tf tree

start the mapping node, slam_gmapping.  Need to remap the name of the LIDAR source to /robot0/laser_0.
ALSO, since STDR already includes a map (but we want to make our own), we'll rename the output of
slam_gmapping "map2":

rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=/robot0/laser_0 /map:=/map2 

  in rviz, add display item "map"
    choose topic: map2  

start an interface to command the robot; MAY be reactive controller;
note: stdr motion-command topicis: /robot0/cmd_vel
therefore, start teleop with remapping out output topic from (default) /cmd_vel to /robot0/cmd_vel:
 rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py /cmd_vel:=/robot0/cmd_vel

  use teleop to drive around; observe map building in rviz

Save the map to disk.  Navigate to the desired directory, remap in map topic to refer to our map2:
  rosrun map_server map_saver -f stdrMap2 map:=map2

This will create two output files:
The pgm file is the same as a png file.
view stdrMap2.pgm and stdrMap2.yaml

can restart stdr, then load saved map with:
rosrun map_server map_server stdrMap2.yaml map:=/map2

SHOULD be able to run amcl with:
rosrun amcl amcl scan:=/robot0/laser_0 map:=/map2
but get error:
  [ WARN] [1487182875.845001512]: No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) for 1487182875.844956 seconds.  Verify that data is being published on the /robot0/laser_0 topic.
(laser topic seems to be active, per rostopic echo)
